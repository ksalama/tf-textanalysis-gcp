# Text Analysis using TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform


The objective is to show how to prepare a text-based datasets, by extracting features like TF.IDF and embeddings, to build Machine Learning models: Document Classification (supervised) and Documents Clustering (unsupervised), in addition to using the extracted features to perform text (cosine) similarity analysis. 

The solution will touch one various GCP technologies, including Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Dataflow, in addition to advances TensorFlow functionalities, such as tf.transform, tf.hub, premade tf.estimators, and custom TF estimators APIs.
